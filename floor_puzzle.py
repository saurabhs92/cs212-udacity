# Hopper, Kay, Liskov, Perlis, and Ritchie live on 
# different floors of a five-floor apartment building. 
#
# Hopper does not live on the top floor. 
# Kay does not live on the bottom floor. 
# Liskov does not live on either the top or the bottom floor. 
# Perlis lives on a higher floor than does Kay. 
# Ritchie does not live on a floor adjacent to Liskov's. 
# Liskov does not live on a floor adjacent to Kay's. 
# 
# Where does everyone live?  
# 
# Write a function floor_puzzle() that returns a list of
# five floor numbers denoting the floor of Hopper, Kay, 
# Liskov, Perlis, and Ritchie.
